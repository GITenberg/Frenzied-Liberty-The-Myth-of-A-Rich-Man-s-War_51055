  <span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'>[5]</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Frenzied Liberty</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c006'>We are engaged in a war, an “irrepressible
conflict,” a most just and
righteous war for a cause as high
and noble as ever inspired a people to put
forth its utmost of sacrifice and valor. To
attain the end for which this peace-loving
nation unsheathed its sword, to lay low
and make powerless the accursed spirit
which brought all this unspeakable misery,
sorrow and ruin upon the world, is our
one and supreme and unshakeable purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is the purpose of the people of
Wisconsin as it is the purpose of the
people of New York and of every other
State in the Union. I give no credence to
and have no patience with those who
would measure as with a thermometer
the loyalty temperature of our communities.
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'>[6]</span>Some dreamers there may be, here as
everywhere, so immersed in their dreams
that the trumpet call of the day has not
yet awakened them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some politicians there may be, here and
elsewhere, so obsessed by the issues which
heretofore were good election assets and
so unable to shake off the inveterate
habits and the formulas and calculations
of a lifetime, that they are unable to
recognize and to share in the sudden
flaming manifestations springing from
the deep of the people’s soul—and after a
while, looking around for their usual
followers, find themselves in chilly loneliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some there are, a small minority always
and getting smaller every day,
among Americans of German birth or
descent who lack the vision to see their
duty or the strength to follow it, and who
stand irresolute, hesitant and dazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vast and overwhelming majority
have acted like true men and loyal Americans.
They are entitled to claim your
sympathetic understanding for the heartache
which is theirs and they are entitled
to claim your trust. It will not be misplaced.
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'>[7]</span>I am taking very little account of that
insignificant number of men of German
origin who, misguided or corrupt, dare by
insidious and underground processes to
attempt to weaken or oppose the resolute
will of the Nation. There are too few of
them to count and their manoeuvres are
too clumsy to be effective. But let them
be warned. There is sweeping through
the country a mighty wave of stern and
grim determination, which bodes ill for
anyone standing in its way.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>II</h3>

<p class='c009'>One element only there is in our
population which does deliberately
challenge our national unity. I
mean the militant Bolsheviki in our midst,
the preachers and devotees of liberty run
amuck, who would place a visionary class
interest above patriotism and who in
ignorant fanaticism would substitute for
the tyranny of autocracy the still more
intolerable tyranny of mob-rule, as for
the time being they have done in Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it were not for the disablement of
Russia, the battle against autocracy
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'>[8]</span>would have been won by now. As so
often before, liberty has been wounded
in the house of its friends. Liberty in
the wild and freakish hands of fanatics
has once more, as frequently in the past,
proved the effective helpmate of autocracy
and the twin brother of tyranny.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out-czaring the czar, its votaries are
filling the prisons with their political opponents,
are practising ruthless spoliation
and savage oppression, and are maintaining
their self-constituted rule by the
force of bayonets. Riot, robbery, famine,
fratricidal strife are stalking through the
land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deadliest foe of democracy is not
autocracy but liberty frenzied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Liberty is not fool-proof. For its beneficent
working it demands self-restraint,
a sane and clear recognition of the practical
and attainable and of the fact that
there are laws of nature which are
beyond our power to change.</p>

<p class='c007'>Liberty can, does and must limit the
rights of the strong, it must increasingly
guard and promote the well-being of
those endowed with lesser gifts for the
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'>[9]</span>struggle for existence and success, it
must strive in every way consistent with
sane recognition of the realities to make
life more worth living to those whose
existence is cast in the mould of the vast
average of mankind; it must give political
equality, equality before the law; it must
throw wide open to talent and worth the
door of opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it must not attempt in fatuous
recklessness to make over humanity on
the pattern of absolute equality. If and
when it does so attempt, it will fail as
that attempt has always failed throughout
history. For an inscrutable Providence
has made inequality of endowment
a fundamental law of nature, animate as
well as inanimate, and from inequality of
physical strength, of brain power and of
character, springs inevitably the fact of
inequality of results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Envy, demagogism, utopianism, well-meaning
uplift agitation may throw
themselves against that basic law of
all being, but the clash will create
merely temporary confusion, destruction
and anarchy, as in Russia; and after
a little while and much suffering,
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'>[10]</span>the supremacy of sanely restrained individualism
over frenzied collectivism
will reassert itself.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>III</h3>

<p class='c009'>Under the system of wisely ordered
liberty, combined with incentive
to individual effort whereof the
foundation was laid by the far-sighted and
enlightened men who created this nation
and endowed it with the most sagacious
instrument of government that the wit of
man has devised, America has grown and
prospered beyond all other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has stood as a republic for nearly a
century and a half, which is far longer
than any other genuine republic has endured
amongst the great nations of the
world since the beginning of the Christian
era. Its past has been glorious, the vista
of its future is one of boundless opportunity,
of splendid fruitfulness for its own
people and the world, if it remains but
true to its principles and traditions, adjusting
their expression and application to
the changing needs of the times in a spirit
of progress, sympathetic understanding
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'>[11]</span>and enlightened justice, but rejecting the
teachings and temptations of false,
though plausible prophets.</p>

<p class='c007'>More and more, of late, do we see the
very foundations of that majestic and
beneficent structure clamorously assailed
by some of those to whom the great republic
generously gave asylum and to
whom she opened wide the portals of her
freedom and her opportunities.</p>

<p class='c007'>These people with many hundreds of
thousands of their countrymen came to
our free shores after centuries of oppression
and persecution. America gave
them everything she had to give—the
great gift of the rights and liberties of
citizenship, free education in our schools
and universities, free treatment in our
clinics and hospitals, our boundless opportunities
for social and material advancement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of them have proved themselves
useful and valuable elements in our many-rooted
population. Some of them have
accomplished eminent achievements in
science, industry and the arts. Certain
of the qualities and talents which they
contribute to the common stock are of
great worth and promise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'>[12]</span>But some of them there are who have
shown themselves unworthy of the trust
of their fellow-citizens; ingrates, disturbers,
ignorant of or disloyal to the spirit of
America, abusers of her hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Some there are who have been blinded by
the glare of liberty as a man is blinded who
after long confinement in darkness, comes
suddenly into the strong sunlight. Blinded,
they dare to aspire to force their guidance
upon Americans who for generations have
walked in the light of liberty.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>They have become drunk with the strong
wine of freedom, these men who until they
landed on America’s coasts had tasted nothing
but the bitter water of tyranny. Drunk,
they presume to impose their reeling gait
upon Americans to whom freedom has been
a pure and refreshing fountain for a century
and a half.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Brooding in the gloom of age-long oppression,
they have evolved a fantastic and
distorted image of free government. In
fatuous effrontery they seek to graft the
growth of their stunted vision upon the
splendid and ancient tree of American
institutions.</i></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'>[13]</span>
<h3 class='c008'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We will not have it so, we who are
Americans by birth or adoption.
We reject these impudent pretensions.
Changes the American people will
make as their need becomes apparent, improvements
they welcome, the greatest
attainable well-being for all those under
our national roof-tree is their aim; but
they will do all that in the American way
of sane and orderly progress—and in none
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Against foes within no less than against
enemies without they will know how to
preserve and protect the splendid structure
of light and order which is the great and
treasured inheritance of all those who
rightly bear the name Americans, of
which the stewardship is entrusted to
them and which, God willing, they will
hand on to their children sound and
wholesome, unshaken and undefiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time is ripe and over-ripe to call a
halt upon these spreaders of outlandish
and pernicious doctrines. The American
is indulgent to a fault and slow to wrath.
But he is now passing through a time of
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'>[14]</span>tension and strain. His teeth are set and
his nerves on edge. He sees more closely
approaching every day the dark valley
through which his sons and brothers must
pass and from which too many, alas, will
not return. It is an evil time to cross
him. He is not in the temper to be
trifled with. He is apt very suddenly to
bring down the indignant fist of his might
upon those who would presume on his
habitual mood of easy-going good nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I speak of the militant Bolsheviki
in our midst as foes of national
unity I mean to include those of American
stock who are their allies, comrades or
followers—those who put a narrow class
interest and a sloppy internationalism
above patriotism, with whom class hatred
and envy have become a consuming passion,
whom visionary obsessions and a
false conception of equality have inflamed
to the point of irresponsibility. But I am
far from meaning to reflect upon those
who, while determined Socialists, are
patriotic Americans.</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe the Socialistic state to be an
impracticable conception, a utopian
dream, human nature being what it is,
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'>[15]</span>and the immutable laws of nature being
what they are. But there is not a little in
Socialistic doctrine and aspirations that is
high and noble; there are things, too, that
are achievable and desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>And to the extent that Socialism is an
antidote to and a check upon excessive
individualism and holds up to a busy and
self-centered and far from perfect world,
grievances to be remedied, wrongs to be
righted, ideals to be striven for, it is a
force distinctly for good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still less do I mean to reflect upon the
labor union movement, which I regard as
an absolutely necessary element in the
scheme of our economic life. Its leaders
have acted with admirable patriotism in
this crisis of the Nation, and on the whole
have been a factor against extreme
tendencies and irrational aspirations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trades unions have not only come to
stay, but they are bound, I think, to become
an increasingly potent factor in our
industrial life. I believe that the most
effective preventive against extreme
State Socialism is frank, free and far-reaching
co-operation between business
and trades unions sobered and broadened
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'>[16]</span>increasingly by enhanced opportunities,
rights and responsibilities.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>V</h3>

<p class='c009'>Business must not deal grudgingly
with labor. We business men must not
look upon labor unrest and aspirations as
temporary “troubles,” as a passing phase,
but we must give to labor willing and
liberal recognition as partner with capital.
We must under all circumstances
pay as a minimum a decent living wage to
everyone who works for a living. We
must devise means to cope with the problem
of unemployment and to meet the
dread advent of sickness, incapacity and
old age in the case of those whose means
do not permit them to provide for a rainy
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must bridge the gulf which now
separates the employer and the employee,
the business man and the farmer, if the
existing order of civilization is to persist.
We must welcome progress and seek to
further social justice. We must translate
into effective action our sympathy for and
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'>[17]</span>our recognition of the rights of those
whose life, in too many cases, is now a
hard and weary struggle to make both
ends meet, and who too often are oppressed
by the gnawing care of how to
find the wherewithal to provide for themselves
and their families. We must, by
deeds, demonstrate convincingly the genuineness
of our desire to see their burden
lightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must all join in a sincere and sustained
effort towards procuring for the
masses of the people more of ease and
comfort, more of the rewards and joys of
life than they now possess. I believe
this is not only our duty but our interest,
because if we wish to preserve the
fundamental lines of our present social
system we must leave nothing practicable
undone to make it more satisfactory and
more inviting than it is now to the vast
majority of those who toil. And I do not
mean those only who toil with their hands,
but also the professional men, the men
and women in modest salaried positions,
in short, the workers in every occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even before the war, a great stirring
and ferment was going on in the land.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'>[18]</span>The people were groping, seeking for a
new and better condition of things. The
war has intensified that movement. It
has torn great fissures in the ancient
structure of our civilization. To restore
it will require the co-operation of all
patriotic men of sane and temperate
views, whatever may be their occupation

be restored just as it was before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The building must be rendered more
habitable and attractive to those whose
claim for adequate houseroom cannot
be left unheeded, either justly or safely.
Some changes, essential changes, must
be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have no fear of the outcome and of the
readjustment which must come. I have
no fear of the forces of freedom unless
they be ignored, repressed or falsely and
selfishly led.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this is not the time for settling
complex social questions. When your

do not discuss family questions. Let us
win the war first. Nothing else must now

divert our aims.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'>[19]</span>When we shall have attained victory
and peace, then will be the time for us to
sit down and reason together and make
such changes in political and social conditions

free from heat and passion, the enlightened
public opinion of the country deems
requisite.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Myth of</span> <br /> <span class='sc'>“A Rich Man’s War”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c006'>Since Pacifism and semi-seditious
agitation have become both unpopular
and risky, the propagandists of
disunion have been at pains in endeavoring
to insidiously affect public sentiment by
spreading the fiction that America’s
entrance into the war was fomented by
“big business” from selfish reasons and for
the purpose of gain. In the same line of
thought and purpose they proclaim that
this is “a rich man’s war and a poor man’s
fight” and that wealth is being taxed here
with undue leniency as compared to the
burden laid upon it in other countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>These assertions are in flat contradiction
to the facts:</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is plainer than that business
and business men had everything to gain
by preserving the conditions which existed
during the two and a half years prior
to April, 1917, under which many of them
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'>[24]</span>made very large profits by furnishing
supplies, provisions and financial aid to
the Allied nations, taxes were light and
this country was rapidly becoming the
great economic reservoir of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is plainer than that any sane
business man in this country must have
foreseen that if America entered the war
these profits would be immensely reduced,
and some of them cut off entirely, because
our Government would step in and
take charge; that it would cut prices right
and left, as in fact it has done; that
enormous burdens of taxation would have
to be imposed, the bulk of which would
naturally be borne by the well-to-do; in
short, that the unprecedented golden
flow into the coffers of business was bound
to stop with our joining the war; or, at
any rate, to be much diminished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best indication of the state of
feeling of the financial community is
usually the New York Stock Exchange.
Well, every time a ship with Americans
on board was sunk by a German submarine
in the period preceding our entrance
into the war, the stock market
shivered and prices declined.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'>[25]</span>When, a little over a year ago, Secretary
Lansing declared that we were “on
the verge of war,” a tremendous smash in
prices took place on the Stock Exchange.
That does not look, does it, as if rich men
were particularly eager to bring on war or
cheered by the prospect of having war?</p>

<p class='c007'>But, it is said, the big financiers of New
York were afraid that the money loaned
by them to the Allied nations might be
lost if these nations were defeated, and
therefore they manoeuvred to get America
into the war in order to save their investments.
A moment’s reflection will
show the utter absurdity of that charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>American bankers have loaned to the
Allied nations—almost entirely to the
two strongest and wealthiest among them,
France and England—about two billions
of dollars since the war started in 1914.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two billions of dollars of Allied
bonds are not held, however, in the
coffers of Eastern bankers, but have been
distributed throughout the country and
are being owned by thousands of banks
and other corporations and individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, they form an insignificant
portion of the total debts of the Allied
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'>[26]</span>nations; they are offset a hundredfold by
their total assets. Even if those nations
were to have lost the war it is utterly inconceivable
that they would ever have
defaulted upon that particular portion of
their debt, because, being their <em>foreign</em>
debt, it has a special standing and intrinsic
security.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is upon the punctual payment of its
foreign obligations that a nation’s credit
in the markets of the world largely
depends, and the maintenance of their
world credit was and is absolutely vital
to England and France. Furthermore,
the greater portion of these obligations
was secured by the deposit of collateral
in the shape of American railroad and
other bonds, etc., which were more than
sufficient in value to cover the debt.</p>

<p class='c007'>But let us assume for argument’s sake
that the Allies had been defeated and had
defaulted, for the time being, upon these
foreign debts; let us assume that the entire
amount of Allied bonds placed in
America had been held by rich men in
New York and the East instead of being
distributed, as it is, throughout the
country. Why, is it not perfectly manifest
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'>[27]</span>that a single year’s American war
taxation and reduction of profits would
take out of the pockets of such assumed
holders a vastly greater sum than any
possible loss they could have suffered by
a default on their Allied bonds, not to
mention the heavy taxation which is
bound to follow the war for years to
come and the shrinkage of fortunes
through the decline of all American
securities in consequence of our entrance
into the war?</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not perfectly manifest to the
meanest understanding that any business
man fomenting our entrance into the war
for the purpose of gain must have been
entirely bereft of his senses and would
have been a fit subject for the appointment
of a guardian to take care of
himself and his affairs?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c009'>Now as to the allegations concerning
taxation: 1. The largest incomes
are taxed far more heavily here
than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'>[28]</span>The maximum rate of income taxation
here is 67%. In England it is 42½%.
Ours is therefore 50% higher than England’s
and the rate in England is the
highest prevailing anywhere in Europe.
Neither republican France nor democratic
England—containing in their cabinets
Socialists and representatives of
labor—nor autocratic Germany have an
income tax rate anywhere near as high as
our maximum rate. And in addition to
the federal tax we must bear in mind our
state and municipal taxes.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Moderate and small incomes, on the
other hand, are subject to a far smaller
rate of taxation here than in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>In America, incomes of married men
up to $2,000 are not subject to any
federal income tax at all.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In England the tax on incomes of $1,000 is 4½%</div>
      <div class='line'>In England the tax on incomes <span class="dblspace">of 1,500</span> is 6¾%</div>
      <div class='line'>In England the tax on incomes <span class="dblspace">of 2,000</span> is 7⅞%</div>

<p class='c007'>(These are the rates if the income is

<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'>[29]</span>$15,000, respectively averages as follows,
as compared to the American rates for
married men:</p>

</table>

<p class='c009'>(If we add the so-called “occupational”
tax, our total taxation on incomes of
$10,000 is 6¾%, and on incomes of
$15,000, 9¾%.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, our income taxation is
more democratic than that of any other
country, in that the largest incomes are
taxed much more heavily, and the small
and moderate incomes much more lightly
than anywhere else, and incomes up to
$2,000 for married men not taxed at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. It is true, on the other hand, that
on very large incomes as distinguished
from the largest incomes, our income tax
is somewhat lower than the English tax,
but the difference by which our tax is
lower than the English tax is incomparably
more pronounced in the case of
small and moderate incomes than of
large incomes. Moreover, if we add to
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'>[30]</span>our income tax our so-called excess
profit tax, which is merely an additional
income tax on earnings derived from
business, we shall find that the total tax
to which rich men are subject is in the
great majority of cases heavier here than
in England or anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. It is likewise true that the English
war excess profit tax is 80% (less various
offsets and allowances) whilst our so-called
excess profit tax ranges from 20%
to 60%.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is entirely misleading to base a
conclusion as to the relative heaviness of
the American and British tax merely on
a comparison of the rates, because the
English tax is assessed on a wholly different
basis from the American tax. As
a matter of fact, Congress has estimated
that the 20% to 60% tax on the American
basis will produce approximately the
same amount in dollars and cents as the
80% tax is calculated to produce in
England. (I know I shall be answered
that we have twice the population of
England and twice the wealth. But it
must be borne in mind that a far larger
proportion of our wealth is represented
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'>[31]</span>by farms and other non-industrial property
and that a far larger proportion of
our people than of the British people are
engaged in agricultural pursuits which
are not affected by the excess profit tax.
I believe it will be found that the total
wealth employed in business in America
is not so greatly superior to the total
wealth similarly employed by Great
Britain.)</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The American excess profit law so-called
taxes all profits derived from business</em> over
and above a certain moderate percentage,
regardless of whether or not such profits
are the result of war conditions. The
American tax is a general tax on income
derived from business, in addition to the
regular income tax. <em>The English tax
applies only to excess war profits</em>; that is,
only to the sum by which profits in the
war years exceed the profits on the three
years preceding the war, which in England
were years of great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, the English tax is
nominally higher than ours, but it
applies only to war profits. The normal
profits of business, i. e., the profits which
business used to make in peace time,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'>[32]</span>are exempted in England. <em>There, only the
excess over peace profits is taxed. Our tax,
on the contrary, applies to all profits</em> over
and above a very moderate rate on the
money invested in business.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, our law-makers have decreed
that normal business profits are taxed
here much more heavily than in England,
while direct war profits are taxed less
heavily. You will agree with me in
questioning both the logic and the justice
of that method. It would seem that it
would be both fairer and wiser and more
in accord with public sentiment if the
tax on business in general were decreased
and, on the other hand, an increased tax
were imposed on specific war profits.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Our federal inheritance tax is far
higher than it is in England or anywhere
else. The maximum rate here on direct
descendants is 27½% as against 20% in
England. In addition to that we have
State inheritance taxes which do not
exist in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Of her total actual war expenditures
(exclusive of loans to her Allies and interest
on war loans), England has raised
less than 15% by taxation (France and
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'>[33]</span>Germany far less), while America is
about to raise by taxation approximately
28% of her total war requirements (exclusive
of loans to the Allied nations and
of the amount to be invested in mercantile
ships, which, being a productive
investment, cannot properly be classed
among war expenditures.)</p>

<h3 class='c008'>III</h3>

<p class='c009'>Much is being said about the
plausible sounding contention that
because a portion of the young
manhood of the Nation has been conscripted,
therefore money also must be
conscripted. Why, that is the very
thing the Government has been
doing. It has conscripted a portion, a
relatively small portion, of the men of the
Nation. It has conscripted a portion, a
large portion, of the incomes of the Nation.
If it went too far in conscripting men, the
country would be crippled. If it went
too far in conscripting incomes and earnings,
the country would likewise be
crippled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'>[34]</span>Those who would go further and conscript
not only incomes but capital, I
would ask to answer the riddle not only
in what equitable and practicable manner
they would do it,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> but what the Nation
would gain by it?</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a trifling fraction of a man’s
property is held in cash. If they conscript
a certain percentage of his possessions
in stocks and bonds, what would the
Government do with them?</p>

<p class='c007'>Keep them? That would not answer
its purpose, because the Government
wants cash, not securities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sell them? Who is to buy them when
everyone’s funds would be depleted?</p>

<p class='c007'>If they conscript a certain percentage
of a man’s real estate or mine or farm or
factory, how is that to be expressed and
converted into cash?</p>

<p class='c007'>Are conscripted assets to be used as a
basis for the issue of Federal Reserve
Bank Notes? That would mean gross
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'>[35]</span>inflation with all its attendant evils,
dangers and deceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would they repudiate a percentage of
the National debt? Repudiation is no
less dishonorable in a people than in an
individual, and the penalty for failure to
respect the sanctity of obligations is no
different for a nation than for an individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact is that the Government would
gain nothing in the process of capital
conscription and the country would be
thrown into chaos for the time being.
The man who has saved would be penalized,
he who has wasted would be favored.
Thrift and constructive effort, resulting
in the needful and fructifying accumulation
of capital would be arrested and
lastingly discouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>I can understand the crude notion of
the man who would divide all possessions
equally. There would be mighty little
coming to anyone by such distribution
and it is, of course, an utterly impossible
thing to do, but it is an understandable
notion. But by the confiscation of
capital for Government use neither the
Government nor any individual would be
benefited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'>[36]</span>A vigorously progressive income tax is
both economically and socially sound.
A capital tax is wholly unsound and
economically destructive. It may nevertheless
become necessary in the case of
some of the belligerent countries to
resort to this expedient, but I can conceive
of no situation likely to arise which
would make it necessary or advisable in
this country. More than ever would
such a tax be harmful in times of war and
post-bellum reconstruction, when beyond
almost all other things it is essential to
stimulate production and promote thrift,
and when everything which tends to
have the opposite effect should be rigorously
rejected as detrimental to the
Nation’s strength and well-being.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is an astonishing lot of hazy
thinking on the subject of the uses of
capital in the hands of its owners. The
rich man can only spend a relatively
small sum of money unproductively or
selfishly. The money that it is in his
power to actually waste is exceedingly
limited. The bulk of what he has must be
spent and used for productive purposes,
just as would be the case if it were spent
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'>[37]</span>by the Government, with this difference,
however, that, generally speaking, the
individual is more painstaking and discriminating
in the use of his funds and at
the same time bolder, more imaginative,
enterprising and constructive than the
Government with its necessarily bureaucratic
and routine regime possibly could
be. Money in the hands of the individual
is continuously and feverishly
on the search for opportunities, i. e., for
creative and productive use. In the
hands of the Government it is apt to lose
a good deal of its fructifying energy and
ceaseless striving and to sink instead into
placid and somnolent repose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taxation presupposes earnings. Our
credit structure is based upon values, and
values are largely determined by earnings.
Shrinkage of values necessarily affects our
capacity to provide the Government with
the sinews of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>There need not be and there should
not be any conflict between profits
and patriotism. I am utterly opposed
to those who would utilize their country’s
war as a means to enrich themselves.
Extortionate profits must not be
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'>[38]</span>tolerated, but, on the other hand, there
should be a reasonably liberal disposition
toward business and a willingness to see
it make substantial earnings. To deny
this is to deny human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men will give their lives to their country
as a matter of plain and natural duty;
men, without a moment’s hesitation, will
quit their business and devote their entire
time and energy and effort to the affairs
of the Nation, as a great many have
done and every one of us stands ready to
do, without any thought of compensation.
But, generally speaking, men will not
take business risks, will not venture, will
not be enterprising and constructive, will
not take upon themselves the responsibilities,
the chance of loss, the strain, the
wear and tear and worry and care of intense
business activity if they do not have
the prospect of adequate monetary reward,
even though a large part of that
reward is taken away again in the shape
of taxation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'>[39]</span>
<h3 class='c008'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Reverting now to the subject of
the conscription of men, I know I
speak the sentiment of all those beyond
the years of young manhood when I
say that there is not one of us worthy of the
name of a man who would not willingly go
to fight if the country needed or wanted us
to fight. But the country does not want or
call its entire manhood to fight. It does
not even call anywhere near its entire
young manhood. It has called, or intends
to call in the immediate future,
perhaps 25% of its men between 20 and
30 years of age, which means probably
about 4% of its total male population of
all ages. In other words, it calls only for
such number of men as appears indicated
by the needs of the country, and as
corresponds to a prudent estimate of the
task before it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am far from meaning to compare the
loss of income or profits with the risk of
life or health to which men on the firing
line are exposed, or to compare financial
sacrifices to those willingly and proudly
borne by the youth of our land and shared
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'>[40]</span>by those near and dear to them. But
I do believe it to be a just contention—not
in the interest of the individual, but
of the welfare of the community—that
the same principle which is applied in the
case of the conscription of men should
hold good for the conscription of income
or profits; i. e., so much thereof should be
taken by the State as is required by a
prudent estimate of the task before it
and as best promotes the accomplishment
of that task, bearing in mind that the
preservation of the country’s economic
power is next in importance for winning
the war to its military power. Vindictiveness,
extremist theories and demagogism
ought to have no place in arriving at that
estimate.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have no patience with or tolerance for
the “war profiteer,” as the term is understood.
The “war hog” is a nuisance and
an ignominy. He should be dealt with
just as drastically as is possible without
doing damage to national interests in the
process. But neither have I patience
with nor tolerance for the man who would
use his country’s war as a means to
promote his pet theories or his political
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'>[41]</span>fortunes at the expense of national unity
at a time when we should all be united in
mutual good will and co-operative effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>And if we do talk about the formula,
“conscription of men—conscription of
wealth,” let it be understood that we have
called less than 5% of the Nation’s entire
male population, but have called from
incomes, business profits and other imposts
falling principally on the well-to-do,
approximately 90% of our war taxation,
not to mention the contribution to the
Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A. and other war
relief activities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me add in passing that <em>the children
of the well-to-do have been taken for the war
in proportionately greater numbers than
the children of the poor</em>, because those
young men who are needed at home to
support dependents or to maintain essential
war industries are exempted from
the draft.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, to an overwhelming degree
the sons of the well-to-do have not waited
to be conscripted. They have volunteered
in masses—a far greater percentage
of them than those in less
advantageous circumstances. That is
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'>[42]</span>merely as it should be. Having greater
advantages, they have corresponding
duties. Not having dependents to take
care of, they can better afford to volunteer
than those less fortunately situated.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the patriotic zeal of the sons of the
well-to-do in coming forward to offer
their lives to the country does give a
doubly false and sickening sound to the
ranting of the agitator who would arouse
class hatred—who calls this “a rich man’s
war and a poor man’s fight” when an
overwhelming percentage of the sons of
the men of means have eagerly and freely
offered themselves for military service,
when <em>the draft exemption regulations discriminate
not, as in former wars, in favor
of the rich man’s son but in favor of the
poor woman’s son</em>, and when capital and
business pay more than four-fifths of our
war taxation directly and a large share of
the remaining one-fifth indirectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not say all this to plead for a reduction
of the taxation on wealth, or in
order to urge that no additional taxes be
imposed on wealth if need be. There is
no limit to the burden which, in time of
stress and strain, those must be willing
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'>[43]</span>to bear who can afford it, except only
that limit which is imposed by the consideration
that taxation must not reach
a point where the business activity of the
country becomes crippled, and its economic
equilibrium is thrown out of gear,
because that would harm every element
of the commonwealth and diminish the
war-making capacity of the Nation.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>V</h3>

<p class='c009'>The question of the individual is not
the one that counts. The question
is not what sacrifices capital should
and would be willing to bear if called
upon, but what taxes it is <em>to the public
advantage</em> to impose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taxation must be sound and wise and
scientific, and cannot be laid in a haphazard
way or on impulse or according to
considerations of politics. Otherwise, the
whole country will suffer. History has
shown over and over again that the laws
of economics cannot be defied with impunity
and that the resulting penalty
falls upon all sections and classes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'>[44]</span>I realize but too well that the burden
of the abnormally high cost of living,
caused largely by the war, weighs heavily
indeed upon wage earners and still more
upon men and women with moderate
salaries. I yield to no one in my desire to
see everything done that is practicable to
have that burden lightened. But excessive
taxation on capital will not accomplish
that; on the contrary, it will
rather tend to intensify the trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>We men of business are ready and willing
to be taxed in this emergency to the
very limit of our ability, and to make
contributions to war relief work and other
good causes, without stint. The fact is
that, generally speaking, capital engaged
in business is now being taxed in America
more heavily than anywhere else in the
world. We are not complaining about
this; we do not say that it may not become
necessary to impose still further
taxes; we are not whimpering and squealing
and agitating, but—we do want the
people to know what are the present facts,
and we ask them not to give heed to the
demagogue who would make them believe
that we are escaping our share of the
common burden.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'>[45]</span>May I hope that I have measurably
succeeded in demonstrating that the
allegations with which the propagandists
of disunion have been assailing the public
mind are without foundation in fact.
And may I add, in conclusion, that the
charge of “big business” having fomented
our entrance into the war is one which,
apart from its intrinsic absurdity, is a
hateful calumny. Business men, great or
small, are no different from other Americans,
and we reject the thought that any
American, rich or poor, would be capable
of the hideous and dastardly plot to bring
upon his country the sorrows and sufferings
of war in order to enrich himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Business men are bound to be exceedingly
heavy financial losers through
America’s entrance into the war. Every
element of self-interest should have caused
them to use their utmost efforts to preserve
America’s neutrality from which
they drew so much profit during the two
and a half years before April, 1917.
Every consideration of personal advantage
commanded men of affairs to stand
with and support the agitation of the
“peace-at-any-price” party. They
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'>[46]</span>spurned such ignoble reasoning; they rejected
that affiliation; they stood for war
when it was no longer possible, with
safety and honor, to maintain peace, because
they are patriotic citizens first and
business men afterward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The insinuation that “big business”
had any share in influencing our Government’s
decision to enter the war is an
insult to the President and Congress, a
libel on American citizenship, and a
malicious perversion or ignorant misconception
of the facts. Those who continue
to circulate that insinuation lay
themselves open to just suspicion of their
motives and should receive neither credence
nor tolerance.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
